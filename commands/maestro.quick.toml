prompt = """Execute this task using Maestro T1 Quick workflow:

{{args}}

T1 Quick protocol:
1. Check .gemini/state/ for any existing active sessions
2. If active session exists: present its status and offer to resume or archive it
3. Skip classification — this is explicitly T1
4. Analyze the task to select the best-fit single agent:
   - Implementation, coding, small feature → coder
   - Bug fix, investigation → debugger
   - Add or fix tests → tester
   - Refactor, restructure → refactor
   - Security concern → security-engineer
   - Performance issue → performance-engineer
   - Documentation update → technical-writer
   - CI/CD, deployment → devops-engineer
   - Database, schema, query → data-engineer
5. Activate the delegation skill for prompt construction
6. Construct a delegation prompt with:
   - Clear task description
   - Tier: T1 Quick
   - Specific files to modify/create
   - Concrete deliverables
   - Validation command
   - Explicit scope boundaries (Do NOT modify files outside the stated scope)
7. Delegate to the selected agent
8. Process the agent's task report
9. Run validation if applicable using the validation skill
10. Write minimal session state to .gemini/state/active-session.md using the minimal-session-state template
11. Present completion summary:
    Quick Task Complete
    Task: [description]
    Agent: [agent-name]
    Files Changed: [list]
    Validation: [pass/fail/skipped]
12. Archive the session state

If the agent fails after one retry, offer the user options:
- Retry with adjusted parameters
- Escalate to T2 Standard workflow
- Abort

Activate the execution skill (T1 Direct Delegation Protocol) and delegation skill."""
