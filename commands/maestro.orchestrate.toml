prompt = """Activate Maestro orchestration mode for the following task:

{{args}}

Follow the adaptive orchestration protocol:
1. Check .gemini/state/ for any existing active sessions
2. If active session exists: present its status and offer to resume or archive it
3. If no active session: activate the task-classification skill
4. Classify the task against the three-dimension rubric (scope, complexity, agent breadth)
5. Present the recommended tier (T1/T2/T3) with reasoning using the classification output template
6. Wait for user confirmation or override
7. Proceed with the confirmed tier:

   T1 Quick:
   - Select the best-fit single agent based on task domain
   - Activate the execution skill (T1 Direct Delegation Protocol) and delegation skill
   - Delegate directly with full task context
   - Validate results using the validation skill
   - Write minimal session state using the minimal-session-state template
   - Present completion summary and archive

   T2 Standard:
   - Activate the implementation-planning skill in lightweight mode (T2)
   - Generate a streamlined plan (no design dialogue)
   - Present the plan for user approval
   - Create session state with tier: T2 via session-management skill
   - Activate the execution skill and execute phases per the plan
   - Archive on completion

   T3 Full:
   - Activate the design-dialogue skill
   - Conduct the full design conversation
   - Generate the complete implementation plan via implementation-planning skill
   - Create session state with tier: T3 via session-management skill
   - Execute all phases via execution skill
   - Run completion protocol and archive

Activate the task-classification skill to begin."""
