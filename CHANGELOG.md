## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Documentation accuracy audit (3-agent parallel)** — Opus-parallel audit of all documentation against source code, fixing 7 discrepancies across 6 files:
  - CHANGELOG.md: Noted `hookEventName` restoration in 1.2.1 (was listed as removed in 1.2.0, re-added in Node.js rewrite)
  - CLAUDE.md: Expanded `allowWithContext()` description to include both `hookEventName` and `additionalContext` fields
  - GEMINI.md: Added missing "no active agent" skip condition to AfterAgent hook description
  - skills/delegation/SKILL.md: Changed "Read-Only Agents" label to "Assessment Agents" for agents with shell access but no write tools
  - skills/design-dialogue/SKILL.md: Aligned section name to match `templates/design-document.md` ("Agent Team")
  - docs/architecture/agent-system.md: Documented hyphen-to-underscore normalization in prompt filename matching
- **Documentation accuracy audit** — Systematic audit of all documentation against source code, fixing discrepancies across 8 files:
  - CLAUDE.md: Added missing `templates/*.md` and `package.json` to runtime surfaces and source-of-truth files
  - README.md: Fixed agent tool table to show baseline tool set (`read_file`, `list_directory`, `glob`, `grep_search`, `read_many_files`, `ask_user`) separately from additional per-agent tools; added `ask_user` to Tool Access Philosophy; linked `comprehensive-map.md`
  - USAGE.md: Documented `code_reviewer` quality gate in Phase 4 for both `/maestro:orchestrate` and `/maestro:execute`; fixed incomplete workspace directory tree to include `plans/`, `plans/archive/`, and `parallel/`
  - skills-and-commands.md: Corrected inaccurate claim that `code-review` is activated "transitively via execution skill" — it runs directly in Phase 4
  - system-overview.md: Fixed incomplete hook list summary to mention all four lifecycle hooks
  - agent-system.md: Added missing `after-agent.js` active agent clearing behavior
  - comprehensive-map.md: Added `gemini-extension.json`, `GEMINI.md`, `package.json` to component map; fixed agent names to use canonical `snake_case`; expanded `templates/`, `skills/`, and `tests/` descriptions

### Changed

- **src/lib reorganization** — Flat 13-module `src/lib/` directory decomposed into domain-scoped subdirectories (`core/`, `config/`, `hooks/`, `state/`, `dispatch/`) with single-responsibility modules and improved naming conventions
- **Constants dissolved** — Grab-bag `constants.js` eliminated; each constant inlined into its domain owner
- **Mixed-concern files split** — `settings.js` split into `env-file-parser`, `setting-resolver`, `project-root-resolver`; `validation.js` split into `session-id-validator` and `agent-registry`; `dispatch-config.js` split into `integer-parser` and `dispatch-config-resolver`; `stdin.js` split into `stdin-reader` with `get`/`getBool` absorbed into hook facade
- **Improved naming** — `file-utils.js` → `atomic-write.js`, `process.js` → `process-runner.js`, `response.js` → `hook-response.js`, `maestro.js` → `hook-facade.js`, `concurrency.js` → `concurrency-limiter.js`

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-19

### Changed

- **Cross-platform Node.js rewrite** — All bash and python3 hooks and scripts rewritten to pure Node.js (zero npm dependencies) for Windows PowerShell compatibility; `hookEventName` re-added to hook output (removed in 1.2.0 bash version, restored as part of `allowWithContext()` response structure)
- **Layered module architecture** — 13 shared `src/lib/` modules (constants, hook-state, logger, process, response, settings, state, stdin, validation, file-utils, dispatch-config, concurrency, maestro) composed by thin hook and script entry points
- **Hook-state factory pattern** — `createHookState(baseDir)` replaces mutable `_setBaseDirForTest` singleton for clean test isolation
- **Session hook registration** — SessionStart and SessionEnd hooks registered in `hooks/hooks.json`
- **Parallel dispatch output** — Status messages moved from stdout to stderr (via logger) to avoid mixing with result data
- **Settings env resolution** — Uses `os.homedir()` instead of `HOME`/`USERPROFILE` fallback; inline comment stripping in `.env` parsing
- **Process management** — `child.pid` guarded before kill operations; `timeoutMs` validated as positive finite number
- **Path validation** — `resolveActiveSessionPath` validates relative `MAESTRO_STATE_DIR` against path traversal
- **Agent detection** — `MAESTRO_CURRENT_AGENT` env var validated against `KNOWN_AGENTS`; regex patterns hoisted to module-level constants
- **After-agent retry** — Active agent preserved on deny to enable re-validation on retry

### Added

- **91 unit tests** — `tests/unit/` covering all 13 `src/lib/` modules including readJson, stdin piping, timeoutMs validation, concurrency gate, and inline comment parsing
- **Node.js integration tests** — All 8 integration tests migrated from bash to Node.js with `node:test`; consistent `{ concurrency: 1 }` across shared-state tests

### Removed

- **bash/python3 runtime dependencies** — Node.js is guaranteed available via Gemini CLI
- All `.sh` hook and script files replaced by `.js` equivalents

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Hooks-based lifecycle middleware** — BeforeAgent and AfterAgent hooks with shared shell library (`hooks/lib/common.sh`), `safe_main` wrapper for guaranteed JSON output, and advisory error handling
- **Agent tracking** — BeforeAgent/AfterAgent hooks track active agent identity via `/tmp/maestro-hooks/<session-id>/active-agent`; lazy state creation on first write, stale-pruned during BeforeAgent
- **Handoff report validation** — AfterAgent hook validates delegated agent output includes `Task Report` and `Downstream Context`; skips TechLead and non-delegation turns; requests one retry on malformed output
- **Active session gating** — `has_active_maestro_session` helper allows hooks to skip initialization when no Maestro session exists in the workspace
- **Final code review quality gate** — Phase 4 completion requires a `code_reviewer` pass on non-documentation file changes before archival; blocks on unresolved Critical/Major findings with remediation loop
- **14 extension settings** — All `MAESTRO_*` env vars declared in `gemini-extension.json`: `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `WRITER_MODEL`, `DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE`, `MAX_TURNS`, `AGENT_TIMEOUT`, `DISABLED_AGENTS`, `MAX_RETRIES`, `AUTO_ARCHIVE`, `VALIDATION_STRICTNESS`, `STATE_DIR`, `MAX_CONCURRENT`, `STAGGER_DELAY`, `GEMINI_EXTRA_ARGS`, `EXECUTION_MODE`
- **`MAESTRO_WRITER_MODEL`** — Per-agent model override for technical_writer in parallel dispatch
- **`MAESTRO_GEMINI_EXTRA_ARGS`** — Space-separated Gemini CLI flags forwarded to each parallel dispatch process
- **`MAESTRO_STATE_DIR`** — Configurable state directory with `extensionPath` resolution and env/workspace/extension/default precedence
- **`read-active-session.sh`** — Script to resolve the active session file path respecting `MAESTRO_STATE_DIR`
- **macOS timeout fallback** — Cancel-file-based watchdog with SIGTERM/SIGKILL for systems without GNU `timeout`
- **Shell helper library** (`hooks/lib/common.sh`) — `read_stdin`, `json_get`, `json_get_bool`, `respond_allow`, `respond_block`, `log_hook`, `validate_session_id`, `resolve_active_session_path`, `has_active_maestro_session`, `prune_stale_hook_state`
- **Built-in tools expanded** — `read_many_files`, `write_todos`, `ask_user`, and web tools added across agents
- **`activate_skill` guidance** — Agents and skills document how to activate skills with user consent behavior
- `enter_plan_mode`/`exit_plan_mode` for read-only Phase 1-2 with fallback when Plan Mode unavailable
- `save_memory` for cross-session knowledge persistence at Phase 4
- `{{args}}` parameter forwarding in status and resume commands
- **Integration test suite** — `tests/run-all.sh` covering all hooks, parallel dispatch (args forwarding, config fallback, exit-code propagation), and active-session resolution (8 test files)
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Project-level contributor instructions

### Changed

- **Lazy hook lifecycle** — SessionStart and SessionEnd removed from `hooks.json` registration; hook state created lazily by BeforeAgent and stale-pruned inline (2-hour threshold)
- All 12 agents: switched to `model: auto` (inherits main session model), canonical `grep_search` tool name, unified Handoff Report output contract
- `parallel-dispatch.sh`: sets `MAESTRO_CURRENT_AGENT` per spawned process, forwards `MAESTRO_GEMINI_EXTRA_ARGS`, warns on deprecated `--allowed-tools` flag
- Commands moved from `commands/maestro.*.toml` to `commands/maestro/*.toml` (directory-based namespace)
- Protocols moved from `protocols/` to `skills/delegation/protocols/` (co-located with delegation skill)
- `delegation` skill: prompt-based enforcement documented as defense-in-depth (native frontmatter is primary gate)
- `code-review` skill: updated for orchestration quality gates (post-phase checks and final completion gate); includes current file contents when diff unavailable
- `execution` skill: documents hook lifecycle, adds final code review gate section, includes review status in completion summary
- `session-management` skill: documents lazy hook state lifecycle with BeforeAgent creation and stale pruning
- `design-dialogue` skill: adds Plan Mode handling
- `session-start.sh`: checks for active Maestro session before initializing state
- `session-end.sh`: simplified to minimal cleanup without logging
- Architecture docs rewritten for accuracy against Gemini CLI specification
- Deprecated `--yolo` and `-p` flags replaced with `--approval-mode=yolo` and positional args in dispatch
- Session state template: added `task` field, reconciled `execution_mode`

### Fixed

- Hook advisory behavior: `safe_main` wrapper guarantees JSON output on all code paths; errors emit `{}` instead of crashing
- Hook matchers removed (were too restrictive for SessionStart/SessionEnd)
- AfterAgent validates on retry without re-issuing denial
- `ask_user` parameter schema corrected in design-dialogue skill
- Plan Mode write paths corrected (`exit_plan_mode` path)
- Delegation paths corrected in skills to use `activate_skill` resources
- State template synced with runtime expectations
- `read_file` ignore enforcement and state access asymmetry clarified in skills
- Agent roster corrections: `run_shell_command` removed from refactor, `get_internal_docs` removed from devops_engineer and technical_writer
- macOS timeout support in parallel dispatch

### Removed

- `before-tool.sh`, `before-tool-selection.sh`, `after-tool.sh` hooks — native frontmatter `tools:` handles tool enforcement
- `BeforeModel` hook — Gemini CLI discards model field from hook output
- `permissions.json` and `generate-permissions.sh` — redundant with native frontmatter enforcement
- `validate-agent-permissions.sh` — validated against the removed permissions manifest
- `display_name` field from all agent frontmatter (undocumented by Gemini CLI)
- `excludeTools` patterns — non-functional; use Policy Engine instead
- `hookEventName` from hook output (not consumed by Gemini CLI)

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

- Removed extension settings prompts from install — Gemini CLI doesn't support default values, so users were forced through 13 prompts on install. All settings now use orchestrator defaults and are configurable via environment variables.

### Changed

- README configuration section renamed from "Extension Settings" to "Environment Variables" with all 13 parameters documented

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-15

- Settings references in delegation, execution, session-management, and validation skills
- TechLead orchestrator startup checks with settings resolution
- Filesystem safety protocol for delegated agents (`protocols/filesystem-safety-protocol.md`)
- Workspace bootstrap script for directory safety (`scripts/ensure-workspace.sh`)
- State file I/O scripts for atomic reads and writes (`scripts/read-state.sh`, `scripts/write-state.sh`)
- Agent name validation against `agents/` directory in parallel dispatch (`scripts/validate-agent-permissions.sh`)
- Concurrency cap (`max_concurrent`) and stagger delay (`stagger_delay_seconds`) settings for parallel dispatch
- Execution mode selection (`execution_mode`) in extension settings and session state template
- Workspace readiness startup check in orchestrator
- File-writing enforcement rules across agent base protocol, delegation prompts, and filesystem safety protocol
- Project root auto-injection into all parallel dispatch prompts
- Execution mode gate and state file access protocol in execution skill
- Execution profile requirement in implementation planning skill

### Fixed

- Hardened `parallel-dispatch.sh` against shell injection and edge cases
- Hardened scripts and commands against injection and path traversal attacks
- Stagger delay default changed from 0 to 5 seconds
- File writing rules enforced via `write_file` tool-only policy across all delegation prompts

### Changed

- Execution mode upgraded from sequential-only to PARALLEL (shell-based) as default strategy
- Delegation skill updated with agent name rules and absolute path safety net
- Filesystem safety protocol injected into all delegation prompts
