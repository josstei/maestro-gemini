# Implementation Planning Skill

Activate this skill during Phase 2 of Maestro orchestration, after the design document has been approved. This skill provides the methodology for generating detailed, actionable implementation plans that map directly to subagent assignments.

## Tier-Based Planning Modes

This skill supports two planning modes:

- **T2 Standard (Lightweight)**: Streamlined plan with phase decomposition, agent assignments, file inventory, dependencies, and validation. Omits approach comparison, architecture diagrams, risk matrix, and cost estimation.
- **T3 Full**: Complete implementation plan with all sections. The existing methodology below.

### Detecting the Planning Mode

The TechLead specifies the tier when activating this skill:
- If tier is T2: Generate a lightweight plan using `templates/lightweight-impl-plan.md`
- If tier is T3: Generate a full plan using `templates/implementation-plan.md`
- If no tier specified: Default to T3 (full plan)

### T2 Lightweight Plan Generation

For T2 plans, follow a simplified version of the full methodology:

1. **Input Analysis**: Analyze the task description directly (no design document to reference)
2. **Phase Decomposition**: Apply the same decomposition principles but expect fewer phases (typically 1-4)
3. **Skip**: Approach comparison, architecture diagrams, risk classification matrix, cost estimation table, token budget
4. **Retain**: Phase objectives, agent assignments, file inventory, dependency graph, validation criteria per phase
5. **Output Location**: `.gemini/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>-impl-plan.md`
6. **Template**: Use `templates/lightweight-impl-plan.md`

### T2 Completion Criteria

The lightweight plan is complete when:
- Every aspect of the task maps to at least one phase
- All phase dependencies are acyclic
- Parallel opportunities are identified and marked
- Each phase has clear validation criteria
- File ownership is non-overlapping for parallel phases
- The user has given explicit approval

### T2 Post-Generation

After writing the lightweight plan:
1. Confirm the file path to the user
2. Present the phase summary and dependency graph
3. Ask if the user is ready to proceed to execution
4. Upon approval, create the session state file via the session-management skill with `tier: "T2"`

## Plan Generation Methodology

### Input Analysis
Before generating the plan, thoroughly analyze the approved design document for:
- Components and their responsibilities
- Interfaces and contracts between components
- Data models and their relationships
- External dependencies and integrations
- Technology stack decisions
- Quality requirements that influence implementation order

### Phase Decomposition

Break the implementation into phases following these principles:

1. **Foundation First**: Infrastructure, configuration, and shared types/interfaces come first
2. **Dependencies Flow Downward**: A phase can only depend on phases with lower IDs
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each phase delivers a cohesive unit of functionality
4. **Agent Alignment**: Each phase maps to one or two agent specializations
5. **Testability**: Each phase should be independently validatable

### Phase Ordering Strategy

```
Layer 1: Foundation (types, interfaces, configuration)
    |
Layer 2: Core Domain (business logic, data models)
    |
Layer 3: Infrastructure (database, external services, API layer)
    |
Layer 4: Integration (connecting components, middleware)
    |
Layer 5: Quality (testing, security review, performance)
    |
Layer 6: Documentation & Polish
```

### Parallelization Identification

Phases can run in parallel when:
- They have no shared file dependencies (no overlapping files_created or files_modified)
- They are at the same dependency depth (same layer)
- They do not share data model ownership
- Their validation can run independently

Mark parallel-eligible phases with `parallel: true` and group them into execution batches.

## Implementation Detail Requirements

### Per-Phase Specification

Each phase in the plan must include:

#### Objective
A clear, measurable statement of what this phase delivers.

#### Agent Assignment
Which agent(s) execute this phase, with rationale for selection.

#### Files to Create
For each new file:
- Full relative path from project root
- Purpose and responsibility
- Key interfaces, classes, or functions to define
- Complete type signatures for public APIs

#### Files to Modify
For each existing file:
- Full relative path from project root
- Specific changes required and why
- Expected before/after for critical sections

#### Implementation Details

Provide sufficient detail for the assigned agent to execute without ambiguity:
- Interface definitions with complete type signatures
- Base class contracts with abstract method signatures
- Dependency injection patterns and registration points
- Error handling strategy (error types, propagation, recovery)
- Configuration requirements (environment variables, config files)

#### Validation Criteria
Specific commands to run and expected outcomes:
- Build/compile commands
- Lint/format checks
- Unit test commands
- Integration test commands (if applicable)
- Manual verification steps (if applicable)

#### Dependencies
- `blocked_by`: Phase IDs that must complete before this phase starts
- `blocks`: Phase IDs that cannot start until this phase completes

## Agent Assignment Criteria

### Matching Tasks to Agents

| Task Domain | Primary Agent | Secondary Agent | Rationale |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| System design, architecture | architect | - | Read-only analysis, design expertise |
| API contracts, endpoints | api-designer | coder | Design then implement |
| Feature implementation | coder | - | Full implementation access |
| Code quality review | code-reviewer | - | Read-only verification |
| Database schema, queries | data-engineer | - | Schema + implementation |
| Bug investigation | debugger | - | Read + shell for investigation |
| CI/CD, infrastructure | devops-engineer | - | Full DevOps access |
| Performance analysis | performance-engineer | - | Read + shell for profiling |
| Code restructuring | refactor | - | Write access, no shell needed |
| Security assessment | security-engineer | - | Read + shell for scanning |
| Test creation | tester | - | Full test implementation |
| Documentation | technical-writer | - | Write access for docs |

### Assignment Rules
1. Match the primary task domain to the agent specialization
2. Consider tool requirements — does the task need shell access? Write access?
3. For parallel phases, assign non-overlapping file ownership to each agent
4. Prefer single-agent phases for clarity; use multi-agent only when distinct specializations are needed
5. Never assign more files to an agent than it can handle within its `max_turns` limit

### Token Budget Estimation
Estimate token consumption per phase based on:
- Number of files to read (input tokens)
- Complexity of output expected (output tokens)
- Agent's max_turns limit as upper bound
- Historical averages: ~500 input tokens per file read, ~200 output tokens per file written

### Cost Estimation

#### Per-Phase Cost Factors
- **Model tier**: Pro agents (~$0.01/1K input, ~$0.04/1K output) vs Flash agents (~$0.001/1K input, ~$0.004/1K output)
- **Input complexity**: Number of files read, average file size, context from previous phases
- **Output complexity**: Lines of code generated, number of files created/modified
- **Retry budget**: Add 50% buffer per phase for potential retries (max 2 retries)

#### Estimation Formula
```
Phase Cost = (input_tokens × input_rate + output_tokens × output_rate) × retry_multiplier
```

Where:
- `input_tokens` = files_to_read × 500 + context_tokens
- `output_tokens` = files_to_write × 200 + validation_output
- `retry_multiplier` = 1.5 (accounts for up to 2 retries)

#### Plan-Level Cost Summary
Include this table in every implementation plan:

| Phase | Agent | Model | Est. Input | Est. Output | Est. Cost |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 1 | [agent] | [model] | [tokens] | [tokens] | [$X.XX] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **Total** | | | **[sum]** | **[sum]** | **[$X.XX]** |

## Plan Document Generation

### Output Location
Write the completed implementation plan to:
`.gemini/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>-impl-plan.md`

### Document Structure
Use the implementation plan template from `templates/implementation-plan.md`.

### Required Sections

1. **Plan Overview**: Summary of total phases, agents involved, estimated effort
2. **Dependency Graph**: Visual representation showing phase dependencies and parallel opportunities
3. **Execution Strategy Table**: Stage-by-stage breakdown with agent assignments and execution mode
4. **Phase Details**: Full specification for each phase (objective, agent, files, details, validation, dependencies)
5. **File Inventory**: Complete table mapping every file to its phase and purpose
6. **Risk Classification**: Per-phase risk assessment (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with rationale

### Completion Criteria
The implementation plan is complete when:
- Every component from the design document maps to at least one phase
- All phase dependencies are acyclic (no circular dependencies)
- Parallel opportunities are identified and marked
- Each phase has clear validation criteria
- File ownership is non-overlapping for parallel phases
- The user has given explicit approval of the complete plan

### Post-Generation
After writing the implementation plan:
1. Confirm the file path to the user
2. Present the dependency graph and execution strategy
3. Highlight parallel execution opportunities
4. Provide token budget estimates
5. Ask if the user is ready to proceed to execution (Phase 3)
6. Upon approval, create the session state file via the session-management skill
