# Design Dialogue Skill

Activate this skill when beginning Phase 1 of Maestro orchestration. If Plan Mode is available (`experimental.plan: true` in settings), call `enter_plan_mode` at the start of Phase 1 to indicate that design work is in progress. If Plan Mode is not available, proceed in normal mode — use `ask_user` with `type: 'yesno'` for design approvals and `type: 'choice'` for approach selection. This skill provides the structured methodology for conducting design conversations that converge on approved architectural designs.

## Question Framework

### Principles
- Ask one question at a time — never batch multiple questions
- Prefer multiple choice format with 2-4 options over open-ended questions
- Lead with your recommended option and explain the rationale
- Wait for user response before proceeding to next question
- Adapt follow-up questions based on previous answers

### Required Coverage Areas

Ask questions in this order to progressively narrow the design space:

1. **Problem Scope & Boundaries**
   - What specific problem are we solving?
   - What is explicitly out of scope?
   - What are the expected inputs and outputs?

2. **Technical Constraints & Limitations**
   - Existing technology stack and infrastructure
   - Compatibility requirements with existing systems
   - Performance budgets (latency, throughput, resource limits)
   - Team expertise and familiarity

3. **Technology Preferences**
   - Language and framework preferences
   - Database and storage requirements
   - Third-party service dependencies
   - Build and deployment toolchain

4. **Quality Requirements**
   - Performance targets (response time, concurrent users)
   - Security requirements (authentication, authorization, data protection)
   - Scalability expectations (growth projections, peak loads)
   - Reliability requirements (uptime, disaster recovery)

5. **Deployment Context**
   - Target environment (cloud provider, on-premise, hybrid)
   - CI/CD pipeline requirements
   - Monitoring and observability needs
   - Operational constraints (team size, on-call, maintenance windows)

### Question Format

Present questions using this structure:

```
**[Topic Area]**: [Clear, specific question]

Options:
1. **[Option A]** (Recommended) — [Why this is recommended, key benefits]
2. **[Option B]** — [When this makes sense, trade-offs]
3. **[Option C]** — [When this makes sense, trade-offs]

My recommendation: [Option X] because [concise rationale tied to what we know so far].
```

## Approach Presentation

### When to Present Approaches
Present 2-3 architectural approaches after gathering sufficient requirements (typically after covering scope, constraints, and technology preferences).

### Approach Format

For each approach, provide:

```
### Approach [N]: [Descriptive Name]

**Summary**: [2-3 sentence overview]

**Architecture**:
[Component diagram or description showing key components and their relationships]

**Pros**:
- [Concrete advantage with context]
- [Another advantage]

**Cons**:
- [Concrete disadvantage with context]
- [Another disadvantage]

**Best When**: [Specific conditions where this approach excels]

**Risk Level**: Low | Medium | High
```

### Presentation Rules
- Always lead with your recommended approach
- Explain why the recommended approach best fits the gathered requirements
- Highlight the key differentiator between approaches
- After presenting all approaches, explicitly ask the user to choose
- Accept user's choice without pushback, even if it differs from your recommendation

## Design Convergence Protocol

### Section-by-Section Presentation

Present the design document in sections, validating each before proceeding. Each section should be 200-300 words.

**Presentation Order**:
1. Problem Statement & Requirements
2. Selected Approach & Architecture
3. Component Specifications & Data Flow
4. Agent Team Composition & Phase Plan
5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation
6. Success Criteria

### Validation Format

After each section:

```
---
Does this section accurately capture our discussion? Any changes needed before I proceed to [next section name]?
```

### Revision Protocol
- If user requests changes, revise the section and re-present
- Track which sections are approved vs pending
- Do not proceed to the next section until current section is approved
- If a later section reveals issues with an earlier section, flag the conflict and propose resolution

## Design Document Generation

### Output Location
Write the completed design document to:
`.gemini/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>-design.md`

Where:
- `YYYY-MM-DD` is the current date
- `<topic-slug>` is a lowercase, hyphenated summary of the task (e.g., `user-auth-system`, `data-pipeline-refactor`)

### Document Structure
Use the design document template from `templates/design-document.md`.

### Completion Criteria
The design document is complete when:
- All sections have been presented and approved by the user
- The agent team composition matches the task requirements
- Phase dependencies are clearly mapped
- Success criteria are measurable and specific
- The user has given explicit final approval of the complete document

### Post-Generation
After writing the design document:
1. Confirm the file path to the user
2. Summarize key decisions made during the dialogue
3. Ask if the user is ready to proceed to implementation planning (Phase 2)
